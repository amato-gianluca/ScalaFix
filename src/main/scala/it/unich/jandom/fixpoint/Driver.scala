/**
 * The driver class has two aims: (1) it makes  easier to use fixpoint solvers when the parameters for
 * the algorithms are obtained by an user interface, and therefore may not be statically known; (2) combines
 * together different classes to implement standard behaviors. A driver is still a fixpoint solver,
 * but it does not implement any algorithm and just delegates to other fixpoint solvers by passing them suitable
 * parameters.
